<p><center>Welcome to my Video Production Project!<br><br>
In this project I compiled images, audio, text, and formatting in order to create a pursuading video for why you should visit Minnesota. <br><br>

This video is about Minnesota and outlines a few cool things you can do there on vacation.  I wrote my script first so I knew what I wanted to say in my video.  After I wrote the script, I practiced it a couple times to make sure it sounded good.  Then, I recorded the audio on my phone using a voice recorder app.  <br><br>

Then, I browsed the internet for images that matched key words in my script.  I highlighted my script with the parts where a new image would appear and then chose images for each part.  <br><br>

This is where I then opened Video Editor and began putting the different parts together.  I started by uploading all of the images into Video Editor and arranging them so that they were in order.  Next, I uploaded the voice recording over the images.  <br><br>

Next, I edited the duration of each image in the video to match up with the voice recording.  This is where I spent the bulk of my time on this project.  This took a lot precision work to get it right down to the millisecond so that the image appeared as long as it was supposed to.  I started at the beginning and just worked my way through the entire video editing the length of each image. <br><br>

Then, I went through and animated the video so that it wasn't just images and audio.  This is when I added a subtle background music.  I ended up using an audio called "On Hold" which I found in the Video Editor app.  I lowered the volume so that it was very subtle and wasn't distracting. <br><br>

Next, I looked at each image to decide how I wanted to animate them.  Some of the images I added text over to connect the audio to a visual text element.  This is when I also added motion for how the images appeared.  I also messed around with 3D elements that I found in the Video Editor app.  I added a snowfall 3D visual to the images which contained snow.  I also added a glowing sun 3D visual to the image of the State Fair.  <br><br>

Finally, I uploaded the video to Youtube!
