<p><center>Welcome to my Animation Project!<br><br>
In this project I used Adobe Animate to compile images and text to create a short animation of the three states of matter.  I manipulated the images so that they moved slightly to demonstrate the molecules in each state of matter moving at the pace they are supposed to. <br><br>
I chose to create an animation that showed a visual of what the molecules in each state of matter look like.  I started with solid and placed the molecules and then moved them slightly very slowly.  Then, I demonstrated liquid by placing the molecules and moving them a bit more and a bit farther apart.  And, finally, I demonstrated gas by having the molecules move around more quickly and spreading out in the entire container. <br><br><br>

 

I chose a background image of a beach to match the water theme.  The background was stagnant through the entire video.

I found an image on Google and removed the background so that it did not have a white border and was more transparent.  I kept the back of the jar to add a contrast so that you could see the molecules moving in the jar. <br><br>

I found an H2O molecule on Google and also removed the background of that image so that it was just the molecules.  <br><br>

I added each molecule into its own layer.  I set up the molecules for solid to appear from 1 second to 5 seconds of the video.  In those 5 seconds I arranged a path for each molecule to take that made it move a small bit very slowly. <br><br>

I set up the molecules for liquid to appear from 6 seconds to 10 seconds.  In those 5 seconds, I also arranged a path for each molecule individually to move a bit more a bit faster. <br><br>

Then, I set up the molecules for gas to appear from 11 seconds to 15 seconds.  In those 5 seconds, I arranged a path for each molecule to move quickly throughout the entire container. <br><br>

I created a title by inserting text and changing the font and color to connect with the background better.  I chose to keep the title on the screen for the entire video. <br><br>

I then added headings for each state of matter to appear when it changed.  I started with solid and set a path for it to appear from the left of the screen, stop in the center for a 2 seconds and then slide out of the right of the screen.  Then, for liquid, I did the opposite and had the text slide in from the right of the screen, sit in the middle for 2 seconds, and then exit to the left.  And finally, for gas, I had the text start on the left and then move at more of a diagonal angle toward the middle and then a diagonal angle out to the right.  I chose to use red bold and italicized font to contrast with the molecules. <br><br>

I chose to keep the text very minimal and not provide explanations because I wanted the visual to be the explanation and I didn't want words to take away from the animation itself. <br><br>
