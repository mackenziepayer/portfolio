These are the changes I made throughout this project:<br><br>

1. I began by deciding on what I want my quiz to be on and changed the name accordingly.  I decided that I would create a quiz on commas.  This is why I changed the name to "Ms. Payer's Comma Quiz". <br><br>

2. I changed the background color to a cool blue color.  The exact color is #86B9FF.<br><br>

3. I put two extra lines before the "Start Over" button. <br><br>

4. I put a line before the advertisement line at the bottom to separate it from the quiz.<br><br>

5. I moved the quiz down one line by putting a blank line before the title.<br><br>

6. I changed the question and answer choices to create the actual comma quiz.<br><br>

7. I changed the title font and color to be more complimentary with the background color.  I chose the font "Century Schoolbook" and chose white for the font to stand out against the blue background. <br><br>

 

This was a very interesting and challenging task, but I learned a lot and enjoyed messing with coding!</p>

<p><center>Changes I made: <br><br>

- I began by changing the HTML so that when a word choice is moved to a box it is locked.<br><br>

- I changed the title to match the topic of the quiz: "Parts of Speech". <br><br>

- I changed the directions at the top to be relevant to the actual quiz. <br><br>

- I changed the contents of the boxes to create the content of my quiz (the word list options). <br><br>

- I changed the box titles to "Noun", "Pronoun", "Adjective", and "Verb". <br><br>

- I centered the text in each of those boxes. <br><br>

- I changed the background of the titles for each of the boxes to #d12e57. <br><br>

- I changed the border of the boxes to match the background fill (#d12e57). <br><br>

- I changed the background of the page to #d49fac. <br><br>

- I changed the font of the entire page to "Century Schoolbook". <br><br>

- I changed the word list box to have a border that matches the rest (#d12e57). <br><br>

- I centered the text in each of the word choices in the word list. <br><br>

- I changed the background of each word choices to match the page background (#d59fac). <br><br>

- I changed the sizing of the main container box to be wider and shorter height. <br><br>

- I moved the part of speech boxes to the right.<br><br><br>

 

This has been my favorite project in this course so far.  It made a lot more sense to me and was fun to play around with.  There was one change I wanted to make but couldn't figure out how.  I wanted to center the entire quiz with the page but I could not figure out how to do that within CSS or HTML.  If anyone was able to do this, please share how you made that change! Other than that, I like how my quiz came out and I learned a lot throughout this process!</center></p>
