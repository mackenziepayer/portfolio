<p><center>Book Cover: The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides

I chose to create a rendition of the book cover for The Silent Patient.  I chose this book because it is one of my favorite books of all time, but it also has a lot of hidden secrets that I felt I could portray on the cover.  The book is about this woman, Alicia Berenson, who is a well-known artist.  The story follows along as Alicia shoots and kills her husband and then goes silent after the fact.  A psychotherapist, Theo Faber, becomes determined to work with Alicia to break her silence and find answers.  As the story unravels, we find out that there are two timelines going on at once, before the murder and after.  Throughout the story, Alicia keeps a diary where she discusses this masked man who was watching her outside her windows and how this man prompted the murder.  I don't want to give away the story completely, because I definitely suggest reading it yourself, but these details are important as to why I chose to make my cover the way I did.<br><br>

I began by importing a background of an image of a diary to symbolize that much of the information we learn about Alicia throughout the book is depicted in her diary that she kept before going silent.  The diary is a key factor to the discoveries in this book.  I then added details of the masked man in the woods to the cover by presenting those images on the pages of the diary to show that this information is revealed in the diary specifically.  <br><br>

I chose to use red font because of the murder in the story, as a way to symbolize blood of Alicia's husband.  The font I chose gave me thriller vibes and felt fitting for the title of the story.  <br><br>

Logo: Tippie & Co.

I created a logo that could be used for a clothing company.  The company would be called Tippie & Co as a tribute to my pet turtle, Tippie.  I chose to name this company after Tippie, because he is important to me, but also because of what this company would stand for.  As you can see in the logo, it says "Save the Turtles".  This detail depicts that proceeds from purchases go toward organizations that support sea life and keeping turtles safe.  I wanted that detail to be presented in the logo as to show the consumer the mission of the company.  The middle image of the logo is also a turtle as to add to the phrase "Save the Turtles".  <br><br>

I chose to use gold circles surrounding the turtle and text because gold can appear high end.  This shows that the company sells merchandise that is ethically made and high quality.  Gold can symbolize prestige and in this logo, its purpose is to show that the company holds themselves to a higher standard of merchandise that the consumer can trust.  <br><br>

I chose to use two circles in the logo as a visually pleasing aspect.  The circles contain the logo to specific area and sets a boundary to the logo.  I used two circles so that one could set a boundary for the text, while the other surrounds the turtle in the center.  By doing so, I feel that the viewer can see where the logo ends and it can easily be set apart from other things.  This logo can easily be places on clothing items, packaging items, etc. because it is all contained inside a circle.  <br><br>

I intentionally kept the logo very basic so that the consumer can quickly identify what the company is and there is not an overload of colors and pictures distracting from the purpose of the logo.  The background is transparent so that the image can be placed clearly on any marketing products. <br><br>
